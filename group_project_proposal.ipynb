    "Heart disease is a common health condition that affects many people around the world, with coronary disease being a significant contributor to its prevalence. Coronary artery disease refers to the buildup of plaque in the wall of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, otherwise known as atherosclerosis. Plaque buildup will cause the inside of the arteries to narrow over time, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Various diagnostic measures, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, play crucial roles in assessing the presence and severity of this condition. Given the significant impact of coronary disease on public health, predictive analytics can help us gain a better understanding of the relationship between risk factors and disease development, ultimately guiding efforts to prevent and manage heart disease effectively.\n",

    "Through our predictive analysis, we hope to address the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How can we use diagnostic measurements such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar level, resting electrocardiographic results, â€¦ etc, to classify whether a patitent has heart disease? (Presence = 1,2,3,4; Absence = 0).\n",
