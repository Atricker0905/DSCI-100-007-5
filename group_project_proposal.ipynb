    "Heart disease is a common health condition that affects many people around the world, with coronary disease being a significant contributor to its prevalence. Coronary artery disease refers to the buildup of plaque in the wall of the arteries that supply blood to the heart, otherwise known as atherosclerosis. Plaque buildup will cause the inside of the arteries to narrow over time, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Various diagnostic measures, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, play crucial roles in assessing the presence and severity of this condition. Given the significant impact of coronary disease on public health, predictive analytics can help us gain a better understanding of the relationship between risk factors and disease development, ultimately guiding efforts to prevent and manage heart disease effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our predictive analysis, we hope to address the following question: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How can we use diagnostic measurements such as age, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and ST depression to classify whether a patitent has heart disease? (Presence = 1,2,3,4; Absence = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our dataset:** The dataset we have selected is a subset of a heart disease diagnosis database that contains information about 303 unique patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.

    "We expect to find that patients with a higher age will more likely have heart disease, as age correlates to increased risk due to deteriorating cardiovascular functions (Rodgers et al., 2019). High blood pressure and cholesterol are considered major risk factors, so patients classified with heart disease will likely have higher levels (Fryar et al., 2012). Maximum heart rate has a close inverse relationship to age (Lach et al., 2012). As heart disease risk increases with age, we may find that patients with lower heart rate, likely signifying a higher age, would lead to a higher probability of heart disease. ST depression (seen on ECGs) can be linked to certain heart conditions. ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest can help diagnose coronary atherosclerosis (Lanza et al., 2002). Therefore, we may see that higher ST depression is linked to cases of heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining whether a patient has heart disease based on certain factors is valuable because we can predict risk without extensive medical tests. This saves time and resources. Although this does not replace actual diagnoses, this analysis will help patients understand factors associated with heart disease and ways to prevent it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further investigation could lead to analyzing other variables in the Cleveland dataset, such as fasting blood sugar, to better understand the risk factors associated with heart disease. Moreover, our dataset only contains patient data from one geographic area. A future project could be to compare our data set and predictive model with heart diagnosis data from other databases to determine if the correlation between risk factors and heart disease observed in this dataset is similar for patients in other parts of the world."
